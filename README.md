## Overview of Analysis 
The purpose of the analysis is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. The first part of the analysis a function was created that read three data files and created three separate dataframes. The second part of the analysis, the wikipedia data was merged with the Kaggle metadata before merging each data file was transformed. In the third part of the analysis, the transformed data sets were converted into a single dataframe; and in the final section of the analysis the dataframe and the csv file was added to Postgre SQL database.
